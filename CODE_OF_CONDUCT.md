# Code of conduct

KoT is a public-good initiative. We aim to be a safe, constructive place to collaborate across communities, institutions, and ecosystems.

## Our standards

We expect all participants to:

* Be respectful and collaborative
* Assume good intent and ask clarifying questions
* Give and receive feedback professionally
* Focus on ideas and outcomes, not personal attributes

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, hate speech, personal attacks, unwanted sexual attention, doxxing, or sustained disruption of discussions.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, and any community channels used for KoT work).

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

* If it is safe, ask the person to stop.
* Otherwise, report it to the maintainers.

**Reporting channel:** Not yet set. Until a dedicated address is published, open a GitHub issue titled **"CoC report (private channel requested)"** and include only the minimum necessary information.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including content removal, temporary bans, or permanent bans. Enforcement decisions prioritize safety and confidentiality.
