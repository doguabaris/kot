# KoT governance

This document describes how KoT makes decisions and manages changes. The goal is to keep KoT vendor-neutral, standards-friendly, and oriented to the public good.

## Roles

KoT uses the following roles:

* **Maintainers** are repository administrators who merge changes, coordinate document releases, and enforce project policies.
* **Editors** are contributors who maintain specific documents (for example, [`docs/glossary.md`](./docs/glossary.md)) and incorporate feedback.
* **Contributors** participate through issues, discussions, proposals, and pull requests.

## Decision making

KoT uses rough consensus:

1. Propose changes through a pull request (small changes) or a proposal (significant changes).
2. Keep significant proposals open for discussion for at least 7 days.
3. If there is no sustained objection, maintainers may accept (lazy consensus).
4. If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers decide by majority vote and document the rationale in the merged pull request or issue.

## Changes that require a proposal

Follow [`proposals/README.md`](./proposals/README.md) when proposing changes that affect:

* The charter (mission, scope, deliverables)
* Governance
* Scope expansions that risk "scope creep"
* Partner-facing commitments or official statements

## Transparency

KoT records decisions and rationale in public artifacts:

* Decisions are recorded in issues and pull requests.
* Major changes should include a short "Decision" note that links to the discussion.

## Code of conduct and enforcement

All participation is governed by [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Maintainers handle reports and apply enforcement actions.

## Updating governance

Changes to this document require a proposal and maintainer approval.
