# Contributing to KoT

KoT is an early-stage, document-first initiative. Contributions that improve clarity, scope boundaries, and alignment with existing standards are especially valuable.

## How to contribute

KoT accepts contributions in several forms:

* For small edits, open a pull request with focused changes (typos, clarity, small additions).
* For significant changes, follow [`proposals/README.md`](./proposals/README.md) and open a proposal before or alongside a pull request.
* To share feedback, open an issue describing concerns, missing pieces, or partner requirements.

## Contribution guidelines

When you submit a change:

* Keep changes small and reviewable.
* Prefer clear, neutral language (vendor- and ecosystem-neutral).
* When adding claims, add references to [`docs/references.md`](./docs/references.md) when possible.
* Avoid expanding scope without updating [`docs/scope.md`](./docs/scope.md) and/or [`CHARTER.md`](./CHARTER.md).
