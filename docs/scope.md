# Scope

This document defines what KoT covers and what it intentionally avoids. Use it to check whether a proposed change belongs in KoT.

## In scope

KoT covers:

* Definitions and terminology for knowledge about "things" (entities, systems, phenomena)
* Principles for interoperability, provenance, and integrity
* Use case mapping across ecosystems (knowledge graphs, archives, standards bodies)
* Risk analysis and stakeholder requirements

## Out of scope (initially)

KoT does not cover:

* Building a single "global database"
* Hosting or curating all content
* Mandating a specific storage or compute substrate
* Shipping production software before the specification work stabilizes

## What KoT is not

KoT is not:

* A replacement for Wikipedia/Wikidata, OriginTrail, or any other platform
* A blockchain product
* A space mission; space-based infrastructure is only one possible deployment environment
