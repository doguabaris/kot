# Principles

KoT is guided by the following principles:

1. **Public good by design**: No single entity should control KoT.
2. **Interoperability first**: Align with existing standards and ecosystems.
3. **Provenance-aware**: Preserve where knowledge comes from and how it was produced.
4. **Verifiability**: Support integrity checks and auditability over time.
5. **Minimal core, extensible edges**: Define a small core that ecosystems can extend.
6. **Vendor and substrate neutrality**: Do not depend on a single platform or infrastructure.
7. **Transparency**: Keep decisions and rationale public and reviewable.
