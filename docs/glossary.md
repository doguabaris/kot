# Glossary

This glossary is a working draft and will evolve.

* **Thing (entity)** is a real-world or abstract object of interest, such as a person, place, organization, asset, concept, or phenomenon.
* **Claim (statement)** is an assertion about a thing (for example, "X is located in Y").
* **Relationship** is a typed connection between things (for example, "manufacturedBy", "partOf", "derivedFrom").
* **Knowledge graph** is a graph representation of things and their relationships.
* **Ontology (schema)** is a structured vocabulary that defines types, properties, and constraints.
* **Provenance** is metadata that describes the origin, context, and process by which a claim was produced.
* **Integrity** refers to guarantees that content has not been altered (for example, through hashes or signatures).
* **Snapshot** is a time-bounded capture of a knowledge structure (or its integrity commitments).
* **Conformance** defines what it means to "implement KoT" (future work).
