# Risks

This is a living risk register for KoT. Use it to track risks, discuss mitigations, and avoid surprises during partner outreach.

## Strategic risks

KoT faces the following strategic risks:

* **Scope creep** happens when KoT tries to be "everything to everyone".
* **Governance capture** happens when a single vendor or institution dominates direction.
* **Misframing** happens when KoT is perceived as a space or storage project instead of a knowledge-structure initiative.

## Technical risks

KoT faces the following technical risks:

* **Over-specification** happens when premature rigidity harms adoption.
* **Under-specification** happens when vague definitions prevent interoperability.
* **Misalignment with standards** happens when KoT duplicates existing work and reduces credibility.

## Initial mitigations

To reduce these risks, KoT starts with:

* Maintain clear scope boundaries in [`scope.md`](./scope.md).
* Require proposals for major changes (see [`proposals/README.md`](../proposals/README.md)).
* Prefer a minimal core with extensions and cite existing standards in [`references.md`](./references.md).
