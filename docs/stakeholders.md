# Stakeholders

KoT is designed to be useful to multiple stakeholder groups:

* **Standards bodies** (terminology, conformance, interoperability)
* **Knowledge communities** (curation, governance, provenance practices)
* **Research institutions** (reproducibility, provenance, integrity, long-term preservation)
* **Infrastructure providers** (storage/compute substrate neutrality, replication)
* **Builders** (tooling, adapters, validators — later phases)

## What stakeholders typically need

Stakeholders often need:

* Clear scope boundaries and non-goals
* Neutral governance and licensing clarity
* Compatibility with existing standards and data models
* A realistic adoption path (phased, incremental)
