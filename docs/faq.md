# FAQ

This FAQ answers common questions about KoT's scope, goals, and relationship to existing ecosystems.

## Is KoT a space project?

No. KoT is a knowledge continuity and interoperability initiative. Space-based infrastructure is only one possible environment for replication and preservation.

## Does KoT aim to store "all knowledge"?

No. KoT aims to define structures and rules (terminology, provenance, integrity, interoperability), not to centralize all content.

## Is KoT a blockchain product?

No. KoT is substrate-neutral. It can interoperate with blockchains, decentralized knowledge graphs, and other systems, but it does not require any specific technology.

## How does KoT relate to other ecosystems?

KoT is designed as a coordination layer. It aims to align with and complement existing knowledge graphs, archives, and standards bodies rather than compete with them.

## Who owns KoT?

KoT is intended to be a public good. Governance is defined in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](../GOVERNANCE.md) and will evolve with contributors and partner stewards.
