# Vision

KoT (Knowledge of Things) defines how knowledge about entities ("things") can remain verifiable, provenance-aware, and interoperable over long time horizons. It is designed for use across institutions and infrastructures.

## Why KoT

KoT exists because:

* Knowledge is fragmented and increasingly consumed by machines without reliable provenance.
* Preserving content alone is insufficient; the structure and verifiability of knowledge must survive.
* Future infrastructures (including planet-agnostic environments) will exist, but will not automatically preserve meaning.

## What "Knowledge from Earth to Universe" means

KoT does not promise to "broadcast all knowledge into space." Instead, it sets a continuity requirement: knowledge structures that originate on Earth should remain preservable and reconstructable without dependence on any single Earth-bound institution or platform.
