# Use cases

KoT use cases are intentionally broad at the start. This document will be refined into partner-ready briefs.

## Example use cases

The following examples illustrate where KoT may add value:

* **Interoperable entity knowledge** across institutions (common identifiers and provenance)
* **Provenance and audit trails** for machine-consumed knowledge (artificial intelligence readiness)
* **Long-term continuity** of knowledge structures across disruptive events
* **Cross-ecosystem mapping** between knowledge graphs and archives
* **Integrity snapshots** for time-bounded "state commitments" of knowledge structures
