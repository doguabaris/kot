# Roadmap

The KoT roadmap is presented as *In development*, *Up next*, and *Under consideration* to give a clear picture of what is currently being worked on, what is planned next, and what areas are being evaluated for future work.

This roadmap does not imply guaranteed delivery timelines or commitments. It reflects the current direction of the initiative and focuses on larger work areas rather than every incremental change.

If a work item you are looking for is not listed here, feel free to open an issue at https://github.com/doguabaris/kot/issues. For significant changes (charter, scope, governance), follow [`proposals/README.md`](./proposals/README.md).

## Terminology

* *In development*: Work currently being implemented and actively worked on.
* *Up next*: Work that is ready to start once capacity allows.
* *Under consideration*: Ideas being evaluated for future work. These have no timeline or final decision yet.

## Focus areas

### In development

* W3C Community Group setup (target: https://www.w3.org/community/kot/)
  * Draft a group description based on [`CHARTER.md`](./CHARTER.md) and [`docs/scope.md`](./docs/scope.md).
  * Define participation expectations and meeting cadence.
  * Prepare an initial "call for participation" package.

* Core documentation baseline
  * Keep core documents consistent across [`CHARTER.md`](./CHARTER.md), [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md), and [`docs/`](./docs/).
  * Expand definitions and cross-links to reduce ambiguity and scope drift.

### Up next

* Initiative draft v0.1
  * Tag a v0.1 release of the document set.
  * Add partner-ready summaries derived from the docs (one-pager, FAQ improvements, stakeholder map).

* Ecosystem alignment notes
  * Expand [`docs/references.md`](./docs/references.md) with short "why this matters" notes.
  * Add cross-ecosystem mappings that clarify how KoT complements existing work.

* Proposal process hardening
  * Define "what requires a proposal" examples in [`proposals/README.md`](./proposals/README.md).
  * Establish a lightweight review checklist for proposals and major pull requests.

### Under consideration

* Drafting an initial KoT core model (data model and conformance) as a separate specification track
* Minimal reference implementation to validate the model (later)
* Governance evolution (working groups, steering group, editors' group)
* Long-term stewardship and neutrality guarantees

### Operational considerations

KoT is in an early stage and may be maintained with limited capacity. If you want to help fund or accelerate specific work items, open an issue describing what you want to support and why.
