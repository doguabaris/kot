# Proposals

KoT uses proposals to make significant changes transparent and reviewable.

## When to use a proposal

Create a proposal for changes that affect:

* Charter, scope, or principles
* Governance or decision-making process
* Partner-facing commitments or official positions
* Any change likely to impact multiple stakeholders

## Proposal lifecycle

1. **Draft**: Open an issue describing the proposal and motivation.
2. **Discussion**: Collect feedback for at least 7 days (for significant changes).
3. **Decision**: Maintainers record a decision (accept, reject, or revise).
4. **Merge**: Accepted proposals are implemented through pull requests.

## Suggested template

Use the following sections in proposal documents:

* Summary
* Motivation and problem statement
* Scope impact (updates needed to [`docs/scope.md`](../docs/scope.md) or [`CHARTER.md`](../CHARTER.md))
* Stakeholders affected
* Alternatives considered
* Risks and mitigations
* Decision criteria
