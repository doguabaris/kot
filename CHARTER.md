# KoT charter

This charter defines KoT's mission, scope, non-goals, initial deliverables, and governance references.

## Mission

KoT (Knowledge of Things) is a public-good initiative that defines an interoperable, verifiable, provenance-aware framework for representing knowledge about entities ("things"), their relationships, and the integrity of those representations over time.

## Vision

Knowledge structures that originate on Earth should remain understandable, verifiable, and reconstructable across institutions and infrastructures, including future planet-agnostic environments.

## In scope

KoT focuses on:

* Shared terminology and concepts (see [`docs/glossary.md`](./docs/glossary.md))
* A clear scope boundary (what KoT is and is not)
* Principles for interoperability, provenance, and integrity
* Documented use cases and stakeholder needs
* Draft specifications (later) for data models and conformance criteria

## Out of scope (initially)

KoT does not aim to:

* Create a centralized database of "all knowledge"
* Replace existing knowledge bases, communities, or standards
* Prescribe a single storage, compute, or network substrate
* Ship production software in the initial phase

## Deliverables

KoT's initial deliverables are documents:

* Charter, governance, roadmap
* Vision, scope, principles, glossary, FAQ
* Use cases, stakeholder mapping, risk assessment, references
* Proposal process and tracked proposals

## Principles

KoT follows the principles in [`docs/principles.md`](./docs/principles.md).

## Governance

KoT governance is defined in [`GOVERNANCE.md`](./GOVERNANCE.md).
